## preprocessing1 : <br />

root

<br />
hin-mai, hin-guj....
<br />
|          |.... 
<br />
EDU, GOV,... 
<br />
|
<br />
sub_folder1, sub_folder2....
<br />
|
<br />
file1.txt, file2.txt.... 

Given the above directory structure, the preprocessing1 does the following: <br />
 <br />
- Removes empty lines, leading and trailing spaces of the individual lines.
  <br />
- Combines the files on the basis of the review status, language-pair and  primary domains. for example, one possible output file will be unreviewed_HIN-MAI_EDU.txt and so on.
  <br />
- This will also show the no of lines in each of those output files in terms of primary-domains, lan-pair and review status.
